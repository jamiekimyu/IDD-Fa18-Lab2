## In The Report
Include your responses to the bold questions on your own fork of [this lab report template](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab2). Include snippets of code that explain what you did. Deliverables are due next Tuesday. Post your lab reports as README.md pages on your GitHub, and post a link to that on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Solder your LCD panel

**Take a picture of your soldered panel and add it here!**

## Part B. Writing to the LCD
 
**a. What voltage level do you need to power your display?**
5V

**b. What voltage level do you need to power the display backlight?**
   
**c. What was one mistake you made when wiring up the display? How did you fix it?**
When connecting the DB4-DB7 pins on the LCD, I connected it directly to the corresponding IO pins on the Arduino but did not connect it to ground as the schematic indicated. I fixed it by connected ground to the negative strip on one side of the breadboard, ensuring that the entire row is connected to ground. Then that gave me more room to connect the DB4-DB7 pins both to ground and the IO pins.   

**d. What line of code do you need to change to make it flash your name instead of "Hello World"?**
 
**e. Include a copy of your Lowly Multimeter code in your lab write-up.**


## Part C. Using a time-based digital sensor

**Upload a video of your working rotary encoder here.**


## Part D. Make your Arduino sing!

**a. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?**
 
**b. What song is playing?**


## Part E. Make your own timer

**a. Make a short video showing how your timer works, and what happens when time is up!**

**b. Post a link to the completed lab report your class hub GitHub repo.**
